## About
[ShrineFox.com](https://shrinefox.com) is an ``ASP.NET`` web application with several features. Mainly, it serves as a browser for the Amicitia modding community's mods, tools, guides and cheats.  
It automatically updates its listing via Gamebanana's API every 6 hours.  
Additional utilities for creating game patches and searching for specific game files are included. 
## How it works
The ``.html`` files in the ``./Resources`` folder are used to generate shared layouts for the forum and wordpress blog/news/guides sites, as well as the main ASP.NET site. The ``.css``/``.js`` files are also shared between all of these installations. Also, ``.aspx`` files provide the main, unchanging controls and layout of each page, while the ``.aspx.cs`` files provide the "code behind" the page for dynamically generating content.
### Required to Provide Yourself
- A file named ``amicitia.tsv`` must be placed in the ``./App_Data/`` folder. It is a spreadsheet that can be opened/exported by Google Sheets. [Here is a sample](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KjfcD8c7SEv3fkBYIaqyjX6d6n4of5w3/view?usp=sharing). This is what the Gamebanana webscraper automatically populates, but it can also include non-Gamebanana entries.  
- A file named ``pw.txt`` also goes in the ``./App_Data/`` folder. It contains the password for the Admin page, where you can update ``amicitia.tsv`` on demand, manage a Discord bot, and re-generate HTML on demand.  
- Files named like ``P5msg.txt`` and ``P5flow.txt`` go in the ``./App_Data/txt/`` folder for TextSearch. These are the flowscript/messagescript dumps for each game generated by [Atlus-Script-Tools](https://github.com/TGEnigma/Atlus-Script-Tools) by TGE.
