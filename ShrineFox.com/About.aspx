	I'm a software developer who loves unconventional ways to customize tech-- romhacks, jailbreaking, OS tweaks, you name it.
<br>
<br><h2>Mission</h2>
<br>I want to make modding more accessible for everyone. Everything I create has been made possible by brilliant minds from all across the world.
<br>To give back to the community, on this site I provide video tutorials, step-by-step guides, and collections of useful files.
<br><br><h5><a href="/Recommended">See here for my personal list of recommended resources</a>.</h5>
<br>
<br><h2>Support</h2>
If you would like to support me, please leave a tip via <a href="https://ko-fi.com/shrinefox">Ko-Fi</a>,

<br><h2>Contact</h2>
<br>Message me on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/shrinefox">Ko-Fi</a> if you have any personal requests. This will notify me via e-mail.
	<br>You may also <a href="ryan@shrinefox.com">email me directly</a>, but please be aware I don't frequently check this inbox.

<br><h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
To report a software bug, please <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue">open an issue on Github</a>.
<br>If you have other modding related questions, ask on the <a href="/forum">forum</a>.
<br>For concerns about anything linked here that I didn't make, contact the creator from wherever they posted it.
<br>I generally don't have much control over content curated from <a href="https://gamebanana.com/">Gamebanana.com</a> 
	(appearing in the <a href="/browse">Browse</a> section), but I do make an effort to keep the listing safe for work.
